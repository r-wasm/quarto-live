## Environments in interactive code blocks

For a standard (non-exercise) interactive code block, the default environment label is `"global"`, meaning "the global environment". That means that variables put into the environment in one executable code block can be accessed in by blocks that are subsequently evaluated.

````markdown
```{{webr}}
# Assignment in non-exercise blocks is in the global environment
foo <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

```{{webr}}
# So, non-exercise blocks can share variables
foo + 42
```
````

```{webr}
# Assignment in non-exercise blocks is in the global environment
foo <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

```{webr}
# So, non-exercise blocks can share variables
foo + 42
```

## Exercise environments

On the other hand, we often want to ensure that exercises do not interfere with one another. As such, each exercise is given a unique environment for evaluation. Exercises can access variables defined in the global environment, but not the other way around.

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| setup: true
# Assignment in setup blocks are put into the exercise environment
bar <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```{{webr}}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| autorun: true
# Exercises variables in both their own and the global environment
foo
bar
```

```{{webr}}
# Evaluation in the global environment cannot see variables
# defined in exercise environments
bar
```
````
</details>

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| setup: true
# Assignment in setup blocks are put into the exercise environment
bar <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| autorun: true
# Exercises variables in both their own and the global environment
foo
bar
```

```{webr}
# Evaluation in the global environment cannot see variables
# defined in exercise environments
bar
```

## Manually managing the environment

Environments can be managed manually, if you wish, by setting the `envir` cell option to a shared label. Exercises sharing the same environment label are all executed in the same environment. This can be used to create "follow-on" exercises.

````markdown
```{{webr}}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_1
#| autorun: true
foo2 <- 7
```

```{{webr}}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_2
#| autorun: true
bar2 <- 5
```

```{{webr}}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_3
#| autorun: true
foo2 + bar2
```
````
</details>

```{webr}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_1
#| autorun: true
foo2 <- 7
```

```{webr}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_2
#| autorun: true
bar2 <- 5
```

```{webr}
#| envir: myenv
#| exercise: ex_shared_3
#| autorun: true
foo2 + bar2
```
